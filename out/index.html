        Stringed Instrument Scales
      </h1>
      <p>
        For creative players of nonstandard tunings, Lautists, Banjo Players,
        or anyone who might just need a quick cheat sheet.  I built this because
        I needed it, and it was an excuse to
        <a href="https://github.com/nikonikoniko/scales/tree/master/src/scalez">learn clojure</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This system can handle non-western (quarter, 17 step) scales, multiple sets
        of note-names, as well as
        alternative frettings on instruments.  Please <a href="https://niko.io">get in touch</a>
        to suggest some.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, configure your instrument strings and root note in the left panel.  You will
        see your results in the right.
